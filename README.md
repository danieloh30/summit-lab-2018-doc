# Effectively monitor and troubleshoot your Openshift Cluster 

During this session, the attendees will learn the key concepts around effectively monitoring a Production OpenShift Cluster and the best techniques to troubleshoot different issues with both the platform and the running containers. 

We will create different scenarios (real issues we have dealt with on different enterprise customers these years) and we will see how the monitoring tools handle those errors and how we can troubleshoot them to get our services back to production state.
